## 📘 Overview  

This repository contains a **Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** designed for **IoT networks**.  
The system identifies malicious or abnormal activities in IoT traffic data using advanced ML models such as **XGBoost**.  

It aims to strengthen IoT device security by automatically learning attack patterns from network datasets and detecting potential threats efficiently.

## 🧠 Key Features  

✅ Data Preprocessing & Feature Encoding  
✅ Balanced Training using **SMOTE / RandomOverSampler**  
✅ Multi-class Classification (Normal, PortScan, BruteForce, etc.)  
✅ Model Training & Evaluation using **XGBoost**  
✅ Visual Results – Confusion Matrix & Feature Importance  
✅ Saved Model Artifacts for Deployment
